			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>StatusSop is a web app dedicated to helping Facebook users
			tidy up their online presence for job hunting, college applications,
			family, getting rid of your old embarrassing statuses, or just because...
			</p>
			<h1>The Idea</h1>
			<p>When spring semester senior year came to a close, we saw more and
			more people changing their names on Facebook to hide from recruiters.
			We saw friends do massive clean sweeps of their prior posts.
			And we saw people deleting their Facebooks altogether. This spawned the
			idea of StatusSoap--a way to assist people in making their social media
			more suitable for a professional environment.
			</p>
			<h1>How it Started</h1>
			<p>It began as a project for a software engineering design class
			 at the University of Texas at Austin. Although the final prototype 
			 in the class was fairly basic and crude, StatusSoap generated a lot
			  of interest from classmates and our teacher. From there, we decided
			   to continue development after the class was finished.
